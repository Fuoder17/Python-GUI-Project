# Python-GUI-Project
Desktop Database Application 


Main Language: Python 

Libraries: Tkinter, Sqlite3 

Description

This is a desktop database application that can be launch in the Windows and Mac operating system. This is simple college admission application that will hold a list of newly admitted students. The data held will consist of the student’s First Name, Last Name, Email, and ID. The application allows users to add, deleted, and updated the student data, while also search for specific student data. The graphical user interface was built with Tkinter which represents the frontend of the application. The backend is was built with Sqlite3 where the data will be stored.

Future Enhancement

Instead of the users manually giving students an ID, I would like to implement an auto generator of the student’s ID as the user submits the student’s information.  

To Run

There is executable file for both Windows and Mac in their respectable files.  

Please provide any advice or suggestion in improving code.

Thank You
